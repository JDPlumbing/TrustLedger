# Contributing to TrustLedger

Welcome to the TrustLedger project — a protocol for encoding effort, verifying trust, and rewarding real-world action in compact, cryptographically signed bytes.

We’re building an open-source trust layer for the real world: identity, events, and verifiable experience that doesn’t require credentials, surveillance, or gatekeeping.

## 🔧 How to Contribute

### 🗂️ 1. Fork or Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-name/trustledger
```

### 💻 2. Work on a Module

TrustLedger is organized by scope:

- `chaincode/`: Identity + reputation layer (nouns)
- `eventcode/`: Action + outcome layer (verbs)
- `docs/`: Vision, design specs, architecture
- `poc/`: Local test tools + proof-of-concept experiments
- `db/`: JSON registries + encoding references

### ✅ 3. Open a PR

- Keep commits atomic and descriptive
- Add tests or test data if relevant
- Include reasoning in your PR description (not just what, but why)

## 💡 We Welcome

- Improvements to the identity encoding layer (`chaincode/`)
- Event tuple encoders, decoders, validators (`eventcode/`)
- Registry expansions (skills, anchors, entity types)
- Schema design improvements (Supabase-compatible)
- Vision drafts, manifestos, and architecture critiques
- Tools for local signing, syncing, offline logs, or P2P coordination

## 🧭 Principles

- **Proof of effort > permission**
- **Trying counts, outcomes contextualize**
- **Trust is public, identity is optional**
- **No good deed goes unrewarded**
- **Reputation is earned, not purchased**

This project is built by plumbers, punks, and people who give a damn.
